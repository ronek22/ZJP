| https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint[pylint] | looks for programming errors, helps enforcing a coding standard and sniffs for some code smells. It additionally includes pyreverse (an UML diagram generator) and symilar (a similarities checker).
| https://github.com/rubik/radon[radon] |  tool that computes various metrics from the source code like McCabe's complexity, raw metrics (SLOC, blank lines etc.), halstead metrics, maintainability index 
| https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture[vulture] | finds unused code in Python programs. This is useful for cleaning up and finding errors in large code bases.
